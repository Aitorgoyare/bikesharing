# bikesharing

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results:

There was a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August.

Thursdays are the most popular days to usage

##Summary:

In gerenal, males were the primary users of Citibikes during weekday commutes in the morning and evening. Further analysis is necessary to determine the success of the Citibikes in Des Moines, Iowa.
